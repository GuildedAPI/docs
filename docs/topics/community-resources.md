## Libraries

Guilded's bot API is currently in early access, so you will need explicit approval from a Guilded staff member to use it, and by extension, any of the libraries listed below. The following libraries are not approved, created, or endorsed by Guilded.

## Embed Visualizers

Discord and Guilded both use relatively the same [embed structure](/resources/channel/#embed-object). Sent embeds look a bit different in the official client, but you can use the following resources to easily compose some JSON for use in your Guilded messages.

- [LeoV's Embed Visualizer](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer)
- [Discohook](https://discohook.app) (click on "JSON Data Editor" when you're done)
