# Community Resources

## Libraries

The following libraries are not approved, created, or endorsed by Guilded.

Many of these libraries are represented in the [community-driven server for developers](https://community.guildedapi.com). There you'll find community members who can help answer questions about the API, community libraries, bot creation, and other development questions.

## Embed Visualizers

From an API standpoint, Discord and Guilded use the exact same Embed format. They do look a bit different in the client, but you can use the following resources to easily make some neato JSON for use in your Guilded messages.

- [LeoV's Embed Visualizer](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer)
- [Discohook](https://discohook.app) (click on "JSON Data Editor" when you're done)
