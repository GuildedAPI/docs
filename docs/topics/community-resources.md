# Community Resources

## Libraries

The following libraries are not approved, created, or endorsed by Guilded.

Many of these libraries have dedicated groups in the [community API server](https://community.guildedapi.com), making it an all-in-one place to get help with your favorite Guilded API resources.

\* The official API is currently in early access, so you will need explicit approval from a Guilded staff member to use it, and by extension, the libraries that wrap it.

## Embed Visualizers

Discord and Guilded both use relatively the same [embed structure](/resources/channel/#embed-object). Sent embeds look a bit different in the official client, but you can use the following resources to easily compose some JSON for use in your Guilded messages.

- [LeoV's Embed Visualizer](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer)
- [Discohook](https://discohook.app) (click on "JSON Data Editor" when you're done)
