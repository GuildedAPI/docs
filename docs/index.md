# Introduction

Hey, welcome! This is some documentation for [Guilded](https://guilded.gg)'s user API. This [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/guildedapi/docs), so you know what to do there.

## Userbots & You

Guilded's terms forbid the automation of user accounts. For this reason, these pages are for building applications that make requests to Guilded as an anonymous third party ([here are some examples!](/topics/community-resources#exemplary-projects)). User authentication details will not be covered here.

You can apply for Guilded's early access bot API in the "Bots" tab of any server's settings or at [API-Official](https://www.guilded.gg/API-Official).

## Support
