# Introduction

Hey, welcome! This is some unofficial documentation of the Guilded user API. Please [read the Terms of Use](https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360039728313-Terms-of-use) before using the API. 

This [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/guildedapi/docs), so you know what to do there.

## Userbots & You

Using the API to 'bot' your user account is a gray area in terms of ToU compliance. For this reason, these pages do not condone automating a user account and they exist solely for educational purposes.

There is not yet any publicly available bot API like there is in Discord.

## Support

Need some help? Come ask over at [the community API server](guilded://guilded-api)! ([or here if you don't have the guilded client installed](https://community.guildedapi.com))
